RDKit is a Python/C++ based cheminformatics and machine-learning software environment.
This extension provides the RDKit cartridge for PostgreSQL, which allows to perform
chemical structure searches and manipulations directly within the database.

For more information, see the [official documentation](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/Cartridge.html).

## Usage

### 1. Add the rdkit extension image to your Cluster

Define the `rdkit` extension under the `postgresql.extensions` section of
your `Cluster` resource. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: cluster-rdkit
spec:
  imageName: ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgresql:18-minimal-trixie
  instances: 1

  storage:
    size: 1Gi

  postgresql:
    extensions:
    - name: rdkit
      image:
        # renovate: suite=trixie-pgdg depName=postgresql-18-rdkit
        reference: ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/rdkit:202503.1-18-trixie
      ld_library_path:
        - system
```

### 2. Enable the extension in a database

You can install `rdkit` in a specific database by creating or updating a
`Database` resource. For example, to enable it in the `app` database:

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Database
metadata:
  name: cluster-rdkit-app
spec:
  name: app
  owner: app
  cluster:
    name: cluster-rdkit
  extensions:
  - name: rdkit
```

### 3. Verify installation

Once the database is ready, connect to it with `psql` and run:

```sql
\dx
```

You should see `rdkit` listed among the installed extensions.
